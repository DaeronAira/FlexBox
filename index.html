      <h2>What's Flexbox?</h2>
      <p>It's a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.</p>

      <h2>Why Flexbox?</h2>

      <h2>Columns or rows?</h2>
      <p>Flexbox provides a property called flex-direction that specifies which direction the main axis runs (which direction the flexbox children are laid out in). By default this is set to row, which causes them to be laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default language works in (left to right, in the case of an English browser).</p>
